Dockerized Model Training with MLflow

This directory contains an MLflow project that trains a XGBoost Classifier model on the Marketing Customer Value. The project uses a Docker image to capture the dependencies needed to run training code. Running a project in a Docker environment (as opposed to Conda) allows for capturing non-Python dependencies.
